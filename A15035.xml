            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Whereupon (quoth <hi>Dondolo</hi> with the libertie of Qu√©ene <hi>Aurelias</hi> fauour) I demaunde the cau≈øes why that the Male, and Female, of bruite and wilde creatures loue, cheri≈øh and take comfort, in one anothers companie, onely by the impre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of nature: and man and woman, that are beautified both with the vertues of nature and rea≈øon, many times matches together, make a hell of this holy in≈øtitution.</p>

               <p>Sir (quoth <hi>Faliero</hi>) the aduantage of rea≈øon, with which you haue priueledged man and woman, is the onely cau≈øe thereof: no man will denie, but that there is a difference of conditions,<note place="margin">There is diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitie of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in euery kinde.</note> in creatures of euery kinde: ≈øome hor≈øe, an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈økilfull hor≈øeman, can hardly di≈øorder; and ≈øome in de≈øpite of his rider will haue a iadi≈øh tricke.

               <p>I confe≈ø≈øe with you (quoth <hi>Faliero</hi>) the ouer≈øights of yong men in their choyce,<note place="margin">A reprehen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of forced mariage.</note> but I crie out vpon forcement in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as the extreame≈øt bondage that is: for that the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome of libertie is the death of the one or the other of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.

               <p>Tu≈øh, tu≈øh (quoth <hi>Bargetto,</hi>) among the maried, quarrels in the day, are qualified with ki≈ø≈øes in the night: whereupon groweth this Adage.</p>

But ah, the≈øe were but ≈øw√©et words to betray him≈øelfe, and to blinde his fr√©end.

               <p>The following effect, confirmed olde <hi>Malipieros</hi> opinion: for <hi>Prouolo</hi> ≈øpent ≈øo largely at the beginning, in hope with this flori≈øh, to make accorde betw√©en the Sonne and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as now his Table was furni≈øhed with emptie plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,<note place="margin">The mi≈øery of want.</note> and his Audit bags with a ≈øet of Counters.

               <p>IN the Regi≈øter of Fame, wherein the Monuments of the vertuous are Cronicled, as pre≈øidents for their po≈øteritie, I read, that in the famous Cittie of <hi>Miletum</hi> in <hi>Ionia,</hi> as ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Prince and Gouernour, there raigned a worthie Duke called <hi>Nebeus,</hi> who to comfort and ≈øupport his aged y√©eres, had to his Sonne and onely heire, <hi>Phrigius,</hi> a yong Gentleman of ≈øuch rare towardliues, as it may be a que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether he were more beholding to Nature for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his body, to Vertue for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> qualities of his minde, or to Fortune in ≈øuffering him to be ≈øo nobly borne.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Myos</hi> a neighbour Cittie to <hi>Miletum,</hi> there was al≈øo a Prince of much renowne, named <hi>Pythes,</hi> who≈øe Daughter and heire was faire <hi>Pieria,</hi> by who≈øe vertues all <hi>Ionia</hi> was renowned. The ancient enuie betw√©ene the Citizens of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letum</hi> and <hi>Myos,</hi> was turned into amitie: and the open war betw√©ene Duke <hi>Nebeus</hi> and the noble <hi>Pithes,</hi> was peceably and honourably ended: All ≈øuch happie euents, ≈øucc√©eded this following aduenture. Vpon the Fe≈øtiual day of <hi>Diana,</hi> the Citizens of <hi>Myos,</hi> without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iniurie of Souldiers, might lawfully repaire to <hi>Miletum,</hi> to ≈øacrifice to <hi>Diana,</hi> vpon which ≈øafe conduct, with many other Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of <hi>Myos,</hi> faire <hi>Pieria</hi> waighted on her Mother to <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple, who≈øe rare beauty was ≈øuch, as dazeled the eies of the beholders, like the reflections of a Mirror, placed again≈øt the Sunne.</p>
               <p>Among many that loued, and fewe or none that ≈øawe po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibility of grace, ≈øuch was the renowne of her cha≈øte di≈øoain, yong <hi>Phrigius</hi> behelde <hi>Pieria</hi> with ≈øuch a ≈øetled eye, as <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> Temple ≈øh√©elded him not again≈øt the Arrowes of Loue: but as a wounded Stag at the fir≈øt ≈ø√©emeth little di≈ømaide: ≈øo <hi>Phrigius</hi> with an vnappalled ch√©er, returned to the Takes Pallace, and as a pledge of truce, he ≈øent his hart to <hi>Myos.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20497:81"/>The Ceremonies and Sacrifices of <hi>Diana</hi> ended, the wars renued, the wonted Ma≈ø≈øacres, Murthers, Rapines, and outragious cruelties practi≈øed by the Souldiers of either part: in≈øomuch as Lawe gaue place to Arnies, equitie to violence, and all publique order was peruerted, and vpon the point to be de≈øtroyed. The Captaines of <hi>Myos</hi> encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged their Souldiers of the one part, but the Souldiers of <hi>Miletum</hi> were driuen to comfort their Captaine with a threatning of di≈øgrace. But ah poore <hi>Phrigius,</hi> what an≈øwere ≈øhould≈øt thou make? to ≈ø√©e thy Souldiers ≈ølaine, and thy cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ≈øpoyled, without proffers of re≈øcue were di≈øhonourable: to bend thy forces again≈øt thy owne hart, were vnnatural: to make the be≈øt choi≈øe of the≈øe two euils, required lea≈øure, and iudgement. And therefore adui≈øedly to con≈øider of his e≈øtate, at this time <hi>Phrigius</hi> ≈øati≈øtied his ≈øouldiers with hope of ≈øome ≈øp√©edy venturous exploite, and dangered not his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, with the proffer of any violence: ≈øo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> either power kept their trenches peaceably, but yet with this indifferent perill, that they attended oportunitie, to make the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, and the other Captiues: for the long ciuill conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had now made the e≈øtate of either as de≈øperate, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of two that haue their ≈øub≈øtance vpon the chaunce of Dice, the one to haue all, the other to be vndone.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Phrigius</hi> had with ≈øtender hope thus quieted the acclamations of the people, he retired him≈øelfe into a ≈øolitary Chamber, to be the ≈øole companion of his outragious pa≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with whom he thus deui≈øed.</p>

To proue that I loue, needeth no other te≈øtimony, then the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of your rare perfections, &amp; to giue me life is the only worke of your pittie. Wherefore [Madame] ≈øince the vertue of your eye, hath drawne away my heart, as the Adamant dooth the ≈øteele, I be≈øeech you that my heartles body may ≈øo liue by your ruth, as I may haue ≈øtrength (as well as will) to doe you ≈øeruice: and let it ≈øuffice for more honor of your tryumph, that by the power of beautie, your vertues haue atchiued a more glorious conque≈øt, then might the whole ≈øtrength of <hi>Myos,</hi> and which is more, of a pui≈ø≈øant enemie, you haue made ≈øo perfect a friend, as <hi>Phrigius</hi> ≈øhall hold him≈øelfe in no fortune, ≈øo happie, as to encounter with the oportunitie, to do <hi>Pieria</hi> and her fauourers ≈øeruice, or their enemies damage: if which amends may repaire all iniuries pa≈øt, I ≈øhall holde the ≈øafeconduit ble≈ø≈øed, that licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed you to enter Myletum: if greater ran≈øome be demanded, it mu≈øt be my life: which [if it be your will] ≈øhall forth with bee ≈øacrificed, notwith≈øtanding, in ≈øuch crueltie, <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple ≈øhall be prophaned, before who≈øe Aulter, I receiued my wound from the eyes of faire <hi>Pieria:</hi> but holding it vnpo≈ø≈øible, that a ≈øtonie heart may be enemie to ≈øo many Graces as liue in your face: I Balme my wounds, with hope that I ki≈ø≈øe your gracious hand: &amp; that your an≈øwer wil returne an acceptance of ≈øeruice.</p>
