            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Which generall inuiting, imboldned me ſo far, as I hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marched towards the great Hall, the Skréene whereof, was curiouſly fronted with cloudy Marble, ſupported on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſide the paſſages,<note place="margin">Welcome and Bountie, the porters.</note> with ſtately Pillers of Geate: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the thrée Portalls, ſtood the Images of two men: the one of Allablaſter Marble, bare headed, repreſenting the vertue of welcome: the other of blew Marble, attyred like a Cooke, and by him were artificially painted, Pheaſants, Partriges,
<pb facs="tcp:20497:6"/>Capons, and other coſtly Cates, as the figure of Bountie: at the entry of this ſtately Hall, I was receiued by the Lord of the Pallace, accompanied with diuers Gentlemen of good qualitie, with ſo ciuill and friendly intertainement, as his behauiour blazoned the true knowledge of curteſie: before wée paſt any further, I began to recount the aduenture which brought me thither, and craued his honourable fauor for my diſpatch: why? then (quoth <hi>Segnior Phyloxenus</hi>) for ſo (for ſome cauſe) I name the Lord of the Pallace, I thanke your hard fortune for arriuing you here, to do me this honor: no hard, but happy fortune (quoth I) if I may liue to honor you with any effectual ſeruice, wel (quoth he) after your we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie trauaile, it is more néedefull to prouide for your repoſe, then for a further iourney, and ſo lead mée the way into a faire great Chamber, richly hung with Tapiſtrie: the roofe whereof was Allablaſter plaiſter, emboſt with many curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deuiſes in golde, and in ſundry places in proper colours was ingraued his deuiſe, which was <hi>A Holly tree, full of red beries: and in the ſame, a fluttering Mauis faſt limed to the bowes.</hi> with this poſie in french, <hi>Qui me nourit, me deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it:</hi> And in verie déede, the beries of the trée féedeth this bird, and the barke maketh Lime to fetter her.

In this beautifull place, I embraced the ſalutations of ſuch a braue troupe of Gentlemen, and Gentlewomen, as the honour of the houſeholde might well giue Enuie vnto ſome Princes Court. And leaſt, at my firſt comming, I might bée abaſhed through ſmall acquaintance, <hi>Segnior Philoxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> emboldened mée with a familiar communication,<note place="margin">A ciuill fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight meete for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> and in the ende vppon a conuenient occaſion, demaunded of mée the name of my Countrie?

And are you of that bleſſed Ile (quoth he?) where the people liue in peace &amp; proſperity, vnder the rule of a Maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Quéene,

But the vertue of her Shielde,<note place="margin">Vertue ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the mouth of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, but fireth her heart with malice.</note> I meane her graue Senate, hath returned the Dartes of <hi>Enuie</hi> ſo thick vpon her ſhoulders, as ſhe hath no power to eclips her bright renowne, whoſe vertue ſhineth in <hi>Enuies</hi> deſpight as a Diamond in an obſcure place, or as the Sune through ſmall paſſages, into the bowels of the earth: ſo that happy and thrice happie are you, the Subiects of the good Quéene of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe gracious gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment filleth your Cofers with wealth, ſealeth your dores with peace, and planteth quietneſſe in your Conſcience: ſo that (bleſſed aboue other Nations) you liue abroad, without ſuſpition of danger at home: and at home feareleſſe of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroade. Wherefore, in honour of your Soueraigue, whoſe fame armeth all true knights, with an earneſt deſire to doo her ſeruice, I am glad of the meane to beſtow on you, or any of hir nation, the affection of a friend. Sir (quoth I) the vertue of theſe honorable thoughts blaſeth the true magnanimity of a noble minde, which meaſureth not your fauour by the deſart of others, but with the royaltie of your heart,<note place="margin">The true Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon of a noble minde.</note> and ſo binde thouſands in recogniſance of ſeruice, among which debters I deſire to be inrolled, although I can diſcharge but little. After we had beſtowed a ſmall time in theſe like ſpéeches, he commanded ſome of his ſeruants to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect mée vnto a lodging (if I pleaſed) to be diſpoiled of my ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding attire: who ſtraight waies brought mée into a Bed Chamber, ſo wel accommodated with euery neceſſarie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as might haue ſerued for the repoſe of <hi>Cupid</hi> and his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Ciches:</hi> hauing a faire proſpect into a goodly Garden, beautified with ſuch rare deuiſes, as deſerued to bée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the earthly Paradice of <hi>Tiuoly.</hi>

And certainely, at this inſtant, I delighted more to contemplate of <hi>Segnior Phyloxenus</hi> vertues, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde his ſumptuous buildings, who (as I learned of one of the Seruants) all the yéere opened his dores to euery ciuill Gentleman, and at Chriſtmas, inuited all commers,<note place="margin">A worthie Cuſtome.</note> as a cuſtomarie dutie: ſo large was the preſcription of his curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. But, which ſhined aboue the reſt, he was in his youth, brought vp in the French Court, where, by the grace of God, and labour of ſome good friend (as his behauiours could not but win many) hée learned to ſerue God, with pureneſſe of heart, and not with painted ceremonies,<note place="margin">H. was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant.</note> as his ſuperſtitious Countrie men doe: which was one chiefe cauſe, why he ſpake ſo reuerently of the Quéenes Maieſtie, whoſe vertues make her enemies dumbe, for malice will not let them ſay well, and ſhame forbids them to ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis of her ſacred life: by the time I had talked a while with one of the ſeruants, and put my ſelfe in a more ciuill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then was neceſſarie for trauaile, ſupper was in a redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: which although it excéeded the common order of faſts, yet it paſſed not farre the bounds of ancient cuſtome: for my place at the Table, I had the priueledge of a ſtranger, ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue my degrée, and with the ſame intertainment, were <hi>Frenchmen, Almain, Duchmen</hi> and other Gentlemen,<note place="margin">Other ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers arrmed by the like adue ture.

But in as much, as this was but the firſt night of her raigne, ſhée referred the Proclamation of her lawes vntill the next day, and ſo diſmiſt the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of her ſubiects for that night, which (in ſooth) laſted me but a ſléepe, ſo ſoundly after trauel, I imbraced mine eaſe.</p>
               <p>The next Day noſooner appeared, but the Trumpets ſounded the honor of Chriſtmas: vpon which Sommons, the compauie roſe, and (attired in their moſt ſumptuous wéedes) in the great Chamber attended their Quéene <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> who about Seruice time, (with the Maieſtie of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe) preſented her ſelfe: on whome all the troupe waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the Chappell, where the Seruice was not ſo cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, as in other Churches of Italy, and yet more then agréed with <hi>Segnior Phyloxenus</hi> conſcience, onely to giue no offence, to the ſuperſtitious zeale of others.

               <p>I haue read (quoth <hi>Iſabella</hi>) that there be ſundry kindes of loue.</p>
               <p>The vſe of loue are diuers, quoth <hi>Soranſo,</hi> as in zeale to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God,<note place="margin">The diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of loue.</note> in duety towards our Country, in obedience towards our parents, and in affection towards our fréends.

               <p>Sir,<note place="margin">Defences of Mariage.</note> quoth <hi>Soranſo,</hi> though white be a faire colour, yet are
<pb facs="tcp:20497:11"/>the choyſe of all other colours more rich and glorious: ſo, though <hi>Virginitie</hi> (which is the faireſt flower of a <hi>Single life</hi>) be precious in the ſight of God, and in the opinion of men, yet is <hi>Mariage</hi> more precious, in that it is a ſacred inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, and more honoured of men: the <hi>Married</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently intertained, when the vnmarried are but familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaluted.

               </p>
               <p>I confeſſe, quoth <hi>Iſmarito, Mariage</hi> is an honourable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,<note place="margin">Defences of a ſingle life.</note> inſtituted of God, and embraced of men, but whereon had ſhe her beginning? vpon this cauſe, to kéepe men from a greater inconuenience: as the Law was founded vpon this reaſon to puniſh the treſpaſſes of men. But if no offence had béen giuen, the Law had not néeded: So if man had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued within bounds of reaſon, (which before any commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement giuen; was vnto him a Law) Mariage might haue béen ſpared: and therefore in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> higheſt degrée, is but a vertue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neceſſitie: where <hi>Chaſtitie,</hi> is a deuine vertue, gouerned by the motions of the ſoule, which is immortall, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating of the ſame vertue is alwaies freſh and gréene. The euerſpringing Bay, is the <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> of chaſte <hi>Daphnè,</hi> whome <hi>Apollo,</hi> although he were a ſoueraigne God, could not allure to <hi>Mariage,</hi> which proueth <hi>Chaſtity</hi> a true ſpark of <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> whoſe twinkling reflexions, ſo daſeleth the eyes of imagined Gods (whoſe powers muſt néedes be more great then the greateſt of men) as they cannot ſée an end of their incontinent deſires: whereas the beauty of <hi>Mariage</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times blaſted by fortune, or the frailtie of the Maried. Therfore (think I) by how much deuine things are of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter empriſe then earthly, by ſo much the <hi>Single life</hi> is more worthy then the <hi>Maried.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in aduauntage, (quoth <hi>Lucia Bella</hi>) where <hi>Soranſo</hi> ſaith, that there is great honor done vnto the married, and to the <hi>Single</hi> is giuen light regard, I pray you whether are <hi>Bacchus</hi> minions or the <hi>Muſes</hi> moſt reuerenced? among men
<pb facs="tcp:20497:12"/>whoſe places are hyer then the Cleargies? and among wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe greater then the religious Dames?</p>

               <p>But where Sir <hi>Iſmarito</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Mariage</hi> is but a vertue vpon neceſſity, to reſtraine man from a greater euill: I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue it an eſtate ſet downe by Nature, and that man hath but amplified it with certain ceremonies, to make perfect the determination of nature: For we dayly ſée in vnreaſonable creatures, <hi>Mariage</hi> is (in a ſorte) worſhipped: Fowles of the Aire (I meane) the he and the ſhe, cupple together, flie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, féed together, and neaſt together. The Turtle is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer merie after the death of her Mate: and in many brute beaſtes the like conſtancy is found: But (generally) there is neuer iarre nor miſliking betwéen the Male and Female of vnpollitique creatures:<note place="margin">Vnpollitick creatures reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence mariage.</note> and among the moſt barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that euer liued, by the impreſſon of nature, <hi>Mariage</hi> hath (euermore) béen reuerenced and hououred: Much more ciuill people ought to affect this holy eſtate: And where <hi>Iſmarito</hi> attributes ſuch glory vnto a <hi>Single life,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Daphne</hi> was metamorphoſed into a <hi>Bay</hi> Trée, whoſe branches are alwaies gréene: In my opinion, his reaſon is faired like the <hi>Bay</hi> Trée: for the <hi>Bay</hi> trée is barren of pleaſant fruit, and his pleaſing words of weighty matter. Furthermore, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance is there of faire <hi>Sirinx</hi> coyneſſe, refuſing to be God <hi>Paris</hi> wife? other then that ſhe was metamorphoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fewe vnprofitable Réedes: Or of <hi>Anaxaretes</hi> chaſte cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty towards <hi>Iphis,</hi> ouer then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe remaineth an Image of Stone in <hi>Samarin.</hi> Many other ſuch like naked Monuments remain of nice contemners of <hi>Mariage.</hi> But in the behalfe of <hi>Mariage</hi> thouſands haue béen changed into <hi>Oliue, Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Mulberie,</hi> and other fruitfull trées, ſwéete flowers, Starres, and precious ſtones, by whom the world is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, directed and nouriſhed.

<pb facs="tcp:20497:12"/>wealths, Sterility hath béene reputed ſo vile, as the Aged was of no man honoured that had not children of his owne to do him reuerence.

               <p>Sir, quoth <hi>Iſmarito,</hi> it ſéemeth that you haue read a Leafe more then Saint <hi>Katherins</hi> Nun:<note place="margin">Defences of a ſingle life.</note> for ſhe (ſimply) tried all things, and you (ſubtilly) vſe but what ſerueth your owne turne: you reproach a <hi>Single life,</hi> with <hi>Barrenneſſe,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the fertility of <hi>Mariage;</hi> but had you ſhowen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wéedes with the Corne, bare paſture would haue returned as great a benefite as your harueſt.

               <p>The double effectes of this Sonet, made them freſhly to remember the doubtes they left yeſterday vnreſolued.

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon (quoth <hi>Dondolo</hi> with the libertie of Quéene <hi>Aurelias</hi> fauour) I demaunde the cauſes why that the Male, and Female, of bruite and wilde creatures loue, cheriſh and take comfort, in one anothers companie, onely by the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of nature: and man and woman, that are beautified both with the vertues of nature and reaſon, many times matches together, make a hell of this holy inſtitution.</p>

               <p>Sir (quoth <hi>Faliero</hi>) the aduantage of reaſon, with which you haue priueledged man and woman, is the onely cauſe thereof: no man will denie, but that there is a difference of conditions,<note place="margin">There is diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in euery kinde.</note> in creatures of euery kinde: ſome horſe, an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfull horſeman, can hardly diſorder; and ſome in deſpite of his rider will haue a iadiſh tricke. Some Bauke though ſhe be euil ſerued, wil not ſtraggle forth: &amp; ſome, do the Faulke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner what he can, wil continuallie flie at checkes: ſome hound by no meanes will be rated from riot, and ſome will neuer forſake his vndertaken game: euen ſo ſome man will filch if his hands be faſt bounde, and ſome hauing the aduantage of a bootie, will rather ſtarue, then ſteale: ſome woman, with an houres libertie will offend, and ten yeares louing ſute cannot ouercome ſome other.<note place="margin">Reaſon fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out the imperfection of nature.

<pb facs="tcp:20497:19"/>maried are deuided in deſire, differ in life, and delight in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers loue: Reaſon that findeth out this contrarietie,<note place="margin">Cauſes of comfort in mariage.</note> ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth contention betwéene the vnfortunate couple in Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie thus matched.

               <p>Therefore (think I) the opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> may be imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as a ſound iudgement.</p>
               <p>The whole aſſembly, allowed <hi>Falieroes</hi> reaſon: and <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolo</hi> himſelfe was reaſonably well ſatiſfied. But quoth he, ſince Mariage bringeth with her vnſpeakable ioy, or vncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſorrow: how may a man aſſure himſelfe of the one, or auoide the other? when a womans vnſearcheable heart is the only harbor both of her good &amp; euil conditions: and (once) in appearance, the honourable, and the diſhoneſt, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, &amp; the vicious: and in briefe, euery ſorte of women are naturally beautified with modeſtie. If the good repulſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt requeſt with chaſt diſdaine, the badde with counterfet ſobrietie, will bluſh at incontinent ſutes: if the good vſeth ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as a vertue, the bad with well ordered ſpéech, wil be as highly eſtéemed: if the good with the beautie and benefites of nature, delight: the bad with the floriſh of Art, will no leſſe be fantaſied. So that at the firſt face, the cunningeſt Clarke may be deceiued, in iudging who beſt deſerueth.</p>
               <p>The greateſt Clarke (quoth <hi>Faliero</hi>) proues not alwaies the wiſeſt man, &amp; none more apt to be beguiled then he.

               <p>The corrupteſt Canker bloometh like the ſwéeteſt Eglan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine: the bitter Bullice, reſembleth the pleaſant Damſon, and the ſower Crah, the ſauorie Pippin: Euen ſo good and bad, faire and fowle, chaſte and vnconſtant women are made of one moulde, framed of one forme,<note place="margin">The forme deceiueth, but the qualitie ſheweth the creature.</note> &amp; naturally gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with a ſhamefaſt bluſhing: but as in ſmell the Canker, in taſt the Bullice, and the Crab in reliſh, bewray their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb facs="tcp:20497:20"/>euen ſo with cunning vſage, the ſubtilleſt woman will ſhew her vnnaturall conditions: counterfeits will to kinde: copper holds print, but not touch with gold, fire hid in aſhes, will breake forth in heate: water courſes ſtopt, find out new paſſages: euen ſo the impatient woman, throughly moued, diſcloſeth her paſſions: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proud with ſufferance excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in pompe, and the wanton ſore charged, wil fall to folly.</p>
               <p>Well (quoth <hi>Dondolo,</hi>) notwithſtanding your directions be good, yet the path to heauen is ſo difficult to finde, as the ignorant paſſenger without direction, is like to follow the beaten way to hell, and the ſureſt guide is Experience.</p>
               <p>So that the direction of the Parents,<note place="margin">The foreſight of Parents.</note> is to be imbraced of the Children in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>Parents with regarde, foreſée the euils that negligent Children féele ere they withſtand: Parents prouide liuing to maintaine their Childrens loue.</p>
               <p>Children often times by matching with beggers, diminiſh their parents inheritance.</p>
               <p>Parents labour for neceſſaries to ſupport an houſe-hould.</p>
               <p>Children onely ſéeke for ſilken ragges, to vpholde their pride.</p>
               <p>Parents haue care to match their Children with thoſe of vertuous condition: and Children lightly regard no more then their louers amiable countenance.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe with you (quoth <hi>Faliero</hi>) the ouerſights of yong men in their choyce,<note place="margin">A reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of forced mariage.</note> but I crie out vpon forcement in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as the extreameſt bondage that is: for that the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of libertie is the death of the one or the other of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. The father thinks he hath a happie purchaſe, if hée get a rich yong Warde to match with his daughter: but God he knowes, and the vnfortunate couple often féele, that hée by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſorrow to his Childe, ſlander to himſelfe, and perchance the ruine of an ancient Gentlemans houſe, by the riot of the ſonne in Lawe, not louing his wife.</p>
               <p>But admit there bée no diſagréement betwéene the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which is rather fortune then foreſight in parents, who regarde that the lands and goods bée great, but ſmally waie

               <p>Delicate meate hardly forceth an appetite vnto the ſick. Pleaſure yéelds no ſollace to the ſorrowfull, no more can forcement enforce the frée to fancie.

In dayly action, you may view the libertie of Loue, his contempt to bée conſtrained, and the great compaſſion he vſeth when he is with curteſie acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which account in forced Mariage is ſildome conſidered. There is procurement of friends before plightment of faith: ſafety for liuings before aſſurance of loue, and clapping of hands before knitting of hearts: an occaſion that the ſorro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful parties mourne when they are Married, &amp; reioyſe when by death they are ſeuered.</p>
               <p>

               <p>But <hi>Faliero</hi> maintayned, that Reaſon and Loue, are at deadly food: Reaſon bids thée loue, but where thou art liked,<note place="margin">Reaſon and Loue, as ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies.</note> and Loue bids thée fancie where thou art hated: Reaſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects for thy benefit, and Loue allures to thy detryment: and to conclude, the office of Reaſon is to appeaſe olde griefes, and the nature of Loue is to raiſe new debates.</p>
               <p>Tuſh, tuſh (quoth <hi>Bargetto,</hi>) among the maried, quarrels in the day, are qualified with kiſſes in the night: whereupon groweth this Adage.</p>

               </q>
               <p>A witneſſe that vnkindneſſe inlargeth Loue, as the wrack of Winter doth the beautie of Sommer: then, although the Parents matche at firſt, bée without the fancie of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, a reconciliation (in fine) will double their comfort.</p>
               <p>Sir (quoth <hi>Soranſo,</hi> fauoring <hi>Falieros</hi> opinion) you wreſt: the Adage is to a contrarie meaning:<note place="margin">Another repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of forcement in mariage.</note> for it is to bée vſed but where there hath béen ſome time perfect loue, and where a grounded loue is, although the Married menace with their tounges, they malice not with their hearts: on the contrarie part: looke what rule the Louer vſeth in loue, the enemie obſerueth in reuenge.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the Maried abhorre before Marriage, they may well diſſemble with their tongues, but will neuer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in their harts: &amp; where there is ſuch a deuiſion in the deſires of the Married, fayre fained ſemblance, will ſoone turne to flat fowle falling out, their thrift goeth forward as the carriage drawne by two Oxen, taile to taile: the huſband will haue no delight to get, nor the wiſe deſire to ſaue: ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants with negligence will waſte, and hyrelings with proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wil win: and (which is worſt) the continuance of mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice wil cuſtome them with mortal hatred: hatred betwéene the Married, bréedeth contention betwixt the parents, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention betwixt the parents, raiſeth quarrels among the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, &amp; quarrels among the kindred, occupieth all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hours with ſlander: ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> for the moſt part, theſe forced mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, engendereth ſorrowes for the maried, diſquietneſſe to both their friends &amp; kindred: but which ſtil renueth griefe, the ſcandal of enemies, endeth in neither of their wretchedneſſe.</p>

               <p>If the wiſeſt and the worthieſt be thus ouertaken in their affections, what eaſie baites may beguile thée, who in yéeres art yong, of ſubſtance delicate and luſtie, and therefore apt to loue: ready in conceit, and of conſideration vnperfect, hotte in deſire, and in diſcretion colde: My ſonne, by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I know, and to prenent thy ouerlikely miſchaunce in choyce, I haue choſen thée a wife, faire to pleaſe thée, rich to continue loue, her Parents my aſſured fréends, and ſhe thy affected louer: loue her well, beare with her inſmall faults, as a woman and the weaker, and bridle thy owne euill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as a man, her head and gouernour: and in thus doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God will multiply his bleſſings vpon you, and make your aged Parents to die in peace, to ſée you liue in proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

               <p>Why (quoth <hi>Franceſchina</hi>) theſe be no queſtions of loue, and therefore you haue libertie to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>No Lady (quoth <hi>Bergetto</hi>) but his vertue may appeare in the anſwere.</p>
               <p>Well (quoth his Miſtreſſe) if you can cleare your treſpas, by one of theſe queſtions, I muſt doo no iniurie to Iuſtice, and therefore ſay your pleaſure.</p>

The couetous Marchant with no more delight heareth the paſſing bell of his rich neighbour, which promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him the firſt loppe of his ſonnes liuing, then the poore Gentleman eyeth the able heire, with deſire to match him, (perhaps) with his faire proud daughter.

The father hearing of the indiſcretion of his ſonne, galleth his hart with gréefe: the mother ſpoyleth her eyes with teares, and the fréend occupieth his tung, in bemoning of his kinſemans folly. There is yet a further ſorrow, bitter to the father, and vnbeneffciall to the ſonne. The father that thought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe his daughter with the Mariage money of his ſonne, is forced to diminiſh his inheritance, for her aduauncement, and by this meanes the ioy which begun in the beauty of his wife, is like to ende in the beggerye of himſelfe: and ſince theſe vnſauery effects growe from the vertue of beauties di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, let <hi>Mounſier Bargetto</hi> burne in his hereſie.</p>

               <p>In the end, becauſe Maiſter Doctor ſhould not be too proud of his conqueſt, nor <hi>Bargetto</hi> ouermuch apalled with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate, quoth <hi>Segnior Fabritio</hi> Iudge of the controuerſies, in a ſingle controuerſie the argument of the one is to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb facs="tcp:20497:36"/>you the benefite of well dooing.</p>
               <p>The Schoolemaiſter gaue <hi>Malipiero</hi> this aduice, with ſuch a temperate geſture:<note place="margin">Loue enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs to doe what we know is amis.</note> that (although good counſell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſled not,) yet he reuerently tolde him, that his experience knew more, then his gréene imagination could attaine: and therefore he would meditate of his louing admonition, and procéede no further without his priaitie. But ah, theſe were but ſwéet words to betray himſelfe, and to blinde his fréend. For vpon the firſt oportunitie <hi>Malipiero</hi> ſpéedes vnto <hi>PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIPPO PROVOLO,</hi> and recountes the importuny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his fréends, with a deſire to haue the Mariage priuily ſolemniſed, ſince that he could not obtaine the open conſent of his parents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prouolo</hi> fearing the danger of delay, was as ready to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie, as <hi>Malipiero</hi> was earneſt to requeſt: inſomuch as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a morning,<note place="margin">An early mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age worketh a late repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> 
                  <hi>Marco Malipiero</hi> was ſet in poſſeſſion of his harts delight: and before night was diſpoſſeſſed of his whole bodies welfare: for his ſorowful Father, and heauy fréends hearing of this ſuddaine Mariage, after they had a while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the raſhnes of <hi>Malipiero,</hi> with the affection of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, menaced to puniſh his ouerſight (in not regarding him) as Strangers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prouolo</hi> on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide, to giue knowledge to his Sonne in lawes fréends,<note place="margin">The reward of pride is pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> that although Fortune had croſſed him, ſhe had not wholy conſumed him: ſet out his ability to the moſt aduantage, much like vnto a market Marchant, that on a New yéeres day morning expoſeth his painted tokens to the richeſt ſhew: his Sonne (in law) was accommodated with the attire and furniture of a Gentleman, and his wife was ſet foorth with the ſhew of rich <hi>Malipieroes</hi> Heires Eſpouſe, and not as poore <hi>Prouoloes</hi> daughter:<note place="margin">The common ſort iudge as they affect.</note> Inſomuch as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort blinded with ſhewes, iudged after their eyes affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reputed old <hi>Malipiero</hi> a cruel couetous Churle, for dealing with <hi>Prouolo</hi> ſo frowardly, that had intreated his Sonne ſo honourably. But theſe murmurings little moued the good ancient knight: for wel he wiſt, this brauery was but a blaſe, as ſoone ended as the flame of a dry Faggot. And which ſhould auenge him, this pride promiſed a change, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
<pb facs="tcp:20497:36"/>with as much pennurie as the other with pompe.</p>
               <p>The following effect, confirmed olde <hi>Malipieros</hi> opinion: for <hi>Prouolo</hi> ſpent ſo largely at the beginning, in hope with this floriſh, to make accorde betwéen the Sonne and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as now his Table was furniſhed with emptie plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,<note place="margin">The miſery of want.</note> and his Audit bags with a ſet of Counters. So that Want, that will make a toothleſſe woman to bite at Braſen walles, entred into <hi>Prouolos</hi> Houſe, and ſwore both him and his whole houſhold vnto the ſtatutes of neceſſity, whoſe lawes were ſo ſtraite, that although they all had great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſorowe, they had no leaſure for ſhifting to ſupply their wants: inſomuch as in ſhort time there was no Neighbour that <hi>Prouolo</hi> was not in his debt or danger, and no good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured youth there abouts, that <hi>Marco Malipiero</hi> had not boorded or cooſoned.</p>
               <p>And what ſhould faire <hi>Felice</hi> doo in this extremetie? liue vpon her huſbands trauell, and be idle her ſelfe? that were no good Huſwiferie: and yet poore <hi>Malipiero</hi> loued her ſo déerly, that he would haue ventured vpon a thouſand infamies, to maintain her in the ſtate of an honeſt Gentlewoman, but although his ſhifts helped, they defraied not her deſire to be braue. A Diamond hath not his grace but in gold, nor a faire Woman her full commendation but in the ornamentes of brauerie. So that attired to her beſt aduantage,<note place="margin">Brauery belen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to Beuty.

                  <hi>Piatſo Richio,</hi> a place where the braueſt Gentlemen aſſembled, and where the fineſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices were ſolde, ſhe taking this liberty to walk, bound y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gal lant yong gentlemen in eurteſte to Court her: curteous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is to be accepted with thanks: acceptance of ſeruice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth acquaintance: acquaintance ingendreth familiarity: and familiarity ſetteth all follies abroach: So that let other Maried men take warning by <hi>Malipieros</hi> hard Fortune,<note place="margin">A neceſſary note.</note> for if their wiues loue gadding like faire <hi>Felice,</hi> &amp; be inconſtant, do want, or finde in their huſbands miſcontentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, twenty to one they will pawn their honors to pleaſe their fancies.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>Felice</hi> loſt nothing by theſe iournies, for ſome one Gallant would preſent her with a <hi>Ventoie,</hi> to coole her ſelfe: ſome other with a mirrour to beholde her ſelfe:
<pb facs="tcp:20497:37"/>and ſome with Lawnes,<note place="margin">Curteſie done with an euill intent.</note> Ruffes, Coyfes, and ſuch neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to ſet out her ſelfe: and yet vpon no diſhonorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but (by your leaue) with hope of an after fauour.</p>
               <p>This trafique faire <hi>Felice</hi> vſed, vntill (among a number that temperately affected her,) <hi>Marino Giorgio</hi> the rich Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant of <hi>Capo verdo</hi> immoderately loued her, and withall the honors of curteſie ſerued her: But notwithſtanding his luſty perſonage might pleaſe: his louely countenance might intice: and his rare wit, paſſing through a ſwéet tung, might be witch a woman in loue: for that <hi>Malipiero</hi> was inriched with theſe perfections: <hi>Felice</hi> regarded <hi>Marino Georgio,</hi> but with an ordinary grace:<note place="margin">Diſdaine haun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth deſire.</note> and had it not béene for that Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inchaunter, Golde (perhaps) would neuer haue béene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant.</p>
               <p>This light account of <hi>Felice</hi> inlarged the affection of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The fire of loue.</note> for as drinke increaſeth the dropſies drouth, ſo diſdaine heapeth coles vpon deſire: whereof <hi>Marino (Teſte ſeipſo)</hi> hath left an infallible authoritie: whoſe torments were ſo gréeuous, as the fire, which of all flames burneth moſt, and appeareſh leaſt, burſt out of his mouth the ſmoake of ſuch furious ſighes, that where he was but late of a pure San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Complection, he ſéemed now nothing but Choller aduſt: So that his fréends mourned, and many moned his ſtrange alteration, who counſelled him to take the Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans aduice: But neither <hi>Galen, Hipocrates,</hi> nor their enemy <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> could ſkill of his cure, ſo that he was in danger to haue conſumed to Cinders, had not <hi>Macrello</hi> the Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Loue vndertaken his health, who comforted him with many ſwéet words of hope:<note place="margin">Phiſick cureth not loue.</note> but <hi>Marino</hi> continually afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe in recounting an impoſſibility of fauour.</p>
               <p>Why (quoth <hi>Macrello</hi>) is not your perſonage ſéemely? Yes, but it doth not pleaſe. Is not your face louely? Yes, but it doth not allure. Is not your wit quick and good? Yes, but it can not perſwade. Is not <hi>Felice</hi> a woman? Yes, and more, an Angell.</p>
               <p>Well, then (quoth <hi>Macrello</hi>) be of good comfort, Angels be not cruell nor ſtéely harted.</p>

               <p>Yea (quoth <hi>Macrello</hi>) but hee wanted one of your chiefeſt beauties.</p>

               <p>Which done, by the direction of <hi>Macrello,</hi> this Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Golde,</hi> made ſuch a paſſage, into a reputed honeſt Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens houſe, as without ſuſpition, <hi>Marino Georgio,</hi> and fayre <hi>Felice,</hi> there (many times) mette, but to what purpoſe,<note place="margin">Gold maketh paſſage into difficult places.</note> I leaue to your conſtructions: and yet thus much I ſay, this Fortune followed: <hi>Marino</hi> in ſhorte ſpace recouered his former Complexion: and it was not long before <hi>Felice</hi> was richer then either Father or Huſband.</p>

               <p>The roote of auncient loue not altogether dead in <hi>Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piero,</hi> was comforted with their interceſſions, and quickned with the hope of amendment: in ſo much, as vpon ſolemne promiſe to be henceforth of good behauiour, hee receiued her to grace: and to repayre her craſed honour, with the fauour of both their parents, he new maried fayre <hi>Felice,</hi> in which holie eſtate,<note place="margin">A reparation of diſhonour.</note> they liued, loued, and agréed many happie yeares afterward together: And with the bones of <hi>Marino Georgio</hi> buried the remembrance of former iniuries.</p>

               <p>In the middeſt of this paſtime, an ancient Gentleman (of the Societie) ſéeing theſe Viperous Beaſts, by cunning vſage, to be made ſo Domeſticke and affable, whether it were vpon an impreſſion of his owne griefe, or of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience he had of another mans Plague, I knowe not: but ſure I am, he burſt into theſe paſſions.</p>

               <p>But (quoth the Gentleman) <hi>Virgil</hi> knew, and taught others how to pacifie this engine.</p>
               <p>It is true (quoth the other) but in teaching the ſecrete vnto his ſcruant, coſt him his own life. So a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowes how to holde her tongue, by hauing of her will, but if a man thinke to ſtay it, he muſt beate her to death.</p>

               <p>Vnſauourie receits turne to holſome effectes: The ſtrongeſt Poyſon is pleaſant in taſte, and the remedie for the poyſoned, offendeth the mouth with tarteneſſe: Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles that ſtinges the hande, maketh Pottage to comfort the heart: the blood of the Scorpion cureth the biting of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. If poyſoned, vnpleaſant, and bitter thinges retayne a vertue for the benefite of man: in my imagination (quoth
<pb facs="tcp:20497:41"/>he) an vnquiet wife is not vnprofitable though ſhe be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vnpleaſant: Her anger kéepeth ſeruants in awe, and her quickneſſe ouerſéeth their negligence: if her tung runne at riot, where ſhe hunts there is ſtore of abuſe, which muſt be chaſed either with blowes or words: if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fury of her ſpéech offend her Huſband, it is like that her outrage groweth from his fault: and where an iniury is offered, it is ſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if the wrong be blamed: but which maketh a ful amends for her furious mood: as the clowdy and rainy day lightly cléereth towards night: euen ſo, though ſhe bitterly ſcowld at boord, ſhe wil be ſure to kiſſe ſwéetly a bed.</p>
               <p>The auncient Gentlemen commending the quick wit of this yong Gentleman,<note place="margin">In blaming, mildens is to be vſed.</note> vſed this circumſtance before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felled his error.</p>
               <p>Ah (quoth he) if wit were as aduiſed in Iudgement, as he is ready in conceite, his imaginations would turne to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull effects: but as faireſt colours ſooneſt ſtaine, as ſwée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt flowers are blaſted with a breath: as beautifull crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are blemiſhed with a little care, as the brighteſt Sun threatneth ſuddaine raine: yea, as euery mortall thing hath his imperfection: euen ſo, wit being mortall,<note place="margin">Wit ſimply in imperfect.</note> and aſſigned by Nature, to make man glorious aboue other creatures, by raſhnes corrupts the ripenes of his conceites, and to good purpoſe, his pride is thus abated: for other wiſe, man which inioyeth wit to worſhip his Creator, and to liue content with the liberties of the ſea, and to kéepe him within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the earth, would ſearch the ſecrets of heauen: and I think diſpoſſeſſe <hi>Pluto</hi> of hell.</p>

               <p>I affirme that Nature hath created nothing to a néedleſſe purpoſe, but not withſtanding our abuſe, or miſchance, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth hurtfull things into occaſions of our help: ſurfite, and

               <p>But take away the cauſe, which procéedeth from our gréefe, and you ſhall finde medicine an enemy to health: and the ſtinge of a Scorpion no better then death: and truſt me, he is to be reckoned a foole, and his miſfortune to paſſe vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued, that wilfully indammageth his health in hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. In like ſort, let him liue vnpittied, to ouerſée the ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſeruants, who will marry a wife, whoſe tung ſhall ouer-rule himſelfe. But more particularly to deſcribe the properties of an vnquiet wife, and more largely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the diſpleaſures of her vnfortunate huſband: I will approoue her lowrings as vnprofitable, as his life is vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: you ſay her quickneſſe ouerſéeth the negligence of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: but I affirme, that her curſtneſſe maketh them as ſwift to runne away,<note place="margin">Shift is vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for Maiſter and Seruant.</note> as they were ſlowe to ſerue her, and common vſe auowes, that often ſhift is neither beneficiall for Maiſter nor ſeruant: for proofe, as the rowling Stone gathereth no Moſſe, and want of vſe canckereth Iron, in likewiſe thrift flyeth the fléeting Seruant, and idlenes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth his ability of ſeruice. Now touching the euill recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe which are ſerued: their wandering ſeruants not onely charge their common accounts, with double wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but with ſecret pilfering, they ſet their maiſters in more déepe arrerages.

And ſo concluded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both enemies to life, and quiet liuing of man. <hi>Phriſio,</hi> being both modeſtly warned, and throughly anſwered, with a bluſhful grace replyed: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the grauity of his perſon, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſound reaſon in his wordes, had

               <p>Continuing this determination, <hi>Caſſandra</hi> buried her imagined brothers head, and with ſpéede iornyed vnto king <hi>Coruinus</hi> Court: before whoſe preſence when ſhe arriued, her mourning Attire, but eſpecially her modeſt countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce moued him to beholde her with an eſpeciall regarde.</p>

                  <hi>Caſſandra</hi> (vpon the graunt of audience) with her eyes ouercharged with teares,<note place="margin">A miſcheefe wel preuented.</note> reported the already diſcourſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, with ſuch an apparance of gréefe, as the King and his Attendants were aſtonied to heare her: and ſure had ſhe not béen happily preuented, ſhe had concluded her determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, with chaſte <hi>Lucretias</hi> deſtinie.<note place="margin">A noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</note> The King comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with many gratious wordes, and promiſed to take ſuch order, that (although he could not be reuiued) her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, ſhould fully be reuenged, and her craſed honour repaired, without blemiſh of her former reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſſandra</hi> vpon theſe comfortable words, a little ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her afflicted hart, with patience attended the Iuſtice of the King: who with a choſen companie, made a Progreſſe to <hi>Iulio,</hi> and entred the Towne with a ſemblance of great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour towards <hi>Promos:</hi>

               <p>By this time, Dinner was ready to bée ſet vpon the Boorde, and Quéene <hi>Aurelia</hi> came agayne vnto the open view, whoſe preſence was as welcome vnto the generall company, as the cleare Sunne (after rough ſtormes) to the wether-wearied Saylour. After ſhe had acquited the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſalutations of the whole troup, ſhe firſt took her place, &amp; then the reſt as they pleaſed, or were accuſtomed.

               </q>
               <p>Whoſo inuented this Sonet, quoth Quéene <hi>Aurelia,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth to be well fauoured of his Miſtreſſe, in that hee kept her ſo carefully in his boſome.</p>
               <p>Nay quoth <hi>Dondolo,</hi> if his eyes were ſo ſubtil, as abſent, he could ſée her behauiour, his affection were more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then his ſeruice neceſſary.</p>
               <p>We giue you to know, quoth <hi>Iſabella,</hi> that we wey not though our Huſbands, a hundred miles off, know our beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours at home.</p>
               <p>I thinke ſo, quoth the playne Doctor, for ſo farre off they may (ſigh at their owne miſchance, but) not chaſten your amiſſe. Perchance they ſhould not be charged with ſuch iniurie, as this company ſhould be (quoth <hi>Maria Belochi</hi>) if we would offer to anſwere your enuious ſuggeſtions.</p>
               <p>Ladies I ſpeak not with intent (quoth <hi>Soranſo</hi>) to make a queſtion of your behauiours, but admit you of al creatures the moſt perfect: yet for that you haue motions, as wel bad, as good, you may many times make ſhew of euill, and yet not doe amiſſe, which if your huſbands be ſo quick ſighted, as to perceiue, they will iudge by their owne eyes, and not by your heartes, and ſo from ſhadowes may growe euill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
               <p>If their ſight bée ſo quicke (quoth <hi>Francheſchina Sancta</hi>) then, though by anegligent treſpas, their wiues ſometime giue them cauſe to ſigh, with a number of louing vſages, they will giue them dayly occaſion of reioycing.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20497:57"/>
               <p>I graunt as much (quoth <hi>Soranſo</hi>) but this will follow,<note place="margin">The euil of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie.</note> the Huſband will turne his owne miſtruſt, to his Wines ſorrow, and receiue her good vſage to his owne priuate comfort.</p>
               <p>Indéede (quoth <hi>Aluiſa Vechio</hi>) the loue of a ielous huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is ſauced with ſuch froward motions, as I had rather be matched with him that regardeth me not at al, then with him that loueth me too much: for of the one, though I am not beloued, yet I ſhall not be much croſſed: of the other, I being too much beloued, I ſhall neuer be in quiet.</p>
               <p>I am not of your minde (quoth <hi>Helena Dulce</hi>) I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue my Huſband ielous,<note place="margin">Hard is the difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and a ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Husband.</note> then careleſſe: for being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, no good vſage will reconcile him: and being ielous, the wife may ſtudy out how to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>Yea, but (quoth <hi>Katharina Triſta</hi>) Men are ſo eaſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, that if they perceiue a woman ſtudieth how to pleaſe them, they ſtraightwayes imagine, ſhe will likewiſe ſtudy how to deceiue them: and therefore, God ſhielde me from a ielous huſband. I haue heard, the white ſtreaked <hi>Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Gilleflower</hi> was the <hi>Metamorphos</hi> of a fayre Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, beheaded by her huſband vpon this ielous thought, that his wife being ſo fayre, could not but bee beloued of the Gods,<note place="margin">Ouid. Metam. lib. 10.</note> although he had no cauſe to ſuſpect men. And where haue yée a larger example of Loue then the aduenture of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> who by extreame ſorrow and ſute, recouered his Wife out of hell,<note place="margin">Eurydice.</note> and by ouer ielous Loue ſent her thither agayne?</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Moſſonigo</hi> was ſmiling out a ſcoffe,<note place="margin">Preuent a ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a Sotte.</note> vpon this tale, which Quéene <hi>Aurelia</hi> intercepted, by ending of the Gentlewomens contention. By your talke of hell (quoth ſhe) I ſée we are out of the way to <hi>Platoes</hi> Paradiſe: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, good, we turne back agayne.</p>
               <p>Indéede Madame (quoth <hi>Fabritio</hi>) if we trauell ſtill, to chooſe the leaſt of euils, it will be long before we come to the Fountaine of goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>Me thinkes (quoth <hi>Iſabella</hi>) the Sonet, which moued the late Queſtion,<note place="margin">A Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of lofty Loue.</note> directs a fayre way to happineſſe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: for it comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth lofty Loue, And if, according to the
<pb facs="tcp:20497:57"/>olde Prouerbe, <hi>The beſt is beſt cheape:</hi> this aduenture giueth hope, and promiſeth good Fortune.</p>
               <p>It is true (quoth <hi>Soranſo</hi>) and I dare vndertake to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue it, the happieſt eſtate in mariage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dondolo,</hi> becauſe he would not be diſgraced, by marying a Burgoys fayre Daughter of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> offered to prooue the contrary.</p>
               <p>Quéene <hi>Aurelia</hi> licenſed them to ſhew their reaſons.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, quoth <hi>Soranſo,</hi> to giue great Ladies and Gentlewomen of calling, their true right and honour, who lightly marry not their Inferiours in reputation, but for ſome eſpecial vertue that doth commend their choyce, and cleareth the blemiſh of her huſbands baſeneſſe? I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, hat he which raiſeth his thought ſo hie vndertaketh (no doubt) a tedious ſuite: his delaies will bee grieuous, and his Soliciters will be well rewarded, in what ſorte ſo euer he be regarded. But what of this? <hi>Quo quid difficilius, eo pulchrius:</hi> Perill maketh honor perfect: the ſtinging of the Bée mends the ſwéetenes of Honie: Roſes beſt refreſhe ourſences, when we prick our hands to reach them:<note place="margin">The euill of a thing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the goodneſſe.</note> He that crackes the Nut, thinkes the kernell ſwéeteſt. The reaſon is, not for that the goodneſſe of a thing, is the better, for the euil thereunto belonging: but, for that the remembrance of the euill, maketh vs holde the good in more reputation: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in loue. The affection which is forced with teares, wonne with ſighes, gaynd with expence, &amp; compaſſed with ſorrow, is held moſt pleaſant, moſt perfect and of longeſt continuance. Againe, eaſie gotten good-wil, becommeth in a while lothſome: the cauſe is, as I conceiue, for that the pleaſure was neuer ſeaſoned with paine. Once a man, in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his better, to increaſe his paſſion, ſhal lack no occaſion, both to ſéeke, ſue, ſigh &amp; ſerue: and yet, to féede his hope, hée ſhall want neither faire lookes, good words, nor poſſibility of fauour. For, for to obtain a great Lady, acquireth many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, not for that ſhe is preciſe to loue, but for that ſhe is wiſe, (or would be ſo thought) in her procéedinges. But whether ſhee loue or no, <hi>Ouid</hi> ſayth, there is no woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but will indure the demand: ſhe is conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruice
<pb facs="tcp:20497:58"/>to be courted:<note place="margin">Loue ſpareth no degree.</note> and in recompence rewardeth with good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. But which moſt ſuſtayneth hope, the example is in continuall vſe: that loue ſpareth no degrée, tranſgreſſeth euery law, &amp; bringeth the mightieſt in bondage to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. King <hi>Cofetua,</hi> the <hi>Affrican,</hi> became enamoured of a Begger: fayre <hi>Venus</hi> eſpouſed ill fauoured <hi>Vukane: Pigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> doted vpon an Image: <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was drowned in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing his owne ſhadow, and mighty <hi>Ioue,</hi> many times, caſt aſide his diuinitie, to dally with ſimple country trulles: then, why ſhould the affected (how bace ſoeuer his eſtate be) deſpayre to attempt a great Lady, when his warrant is ſigned with ſo large Authorities? But whether he ſpéede or faile: be accepted or reiected, well entertained, or ill intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the imagination, that time will inueſt his deſire with delight,<note place="margin">Hope to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe great matters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth more then the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles.</note> is to the affected a Paradiſe, farre excelling the poſſeſſion of equall loue: But if in the end, her affection, or his good fortune, concludeth his wiſh in deſire: her loue, which cannot chooſe but be great: in that ſhe marieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth her calling: And her Abilitie, which allured at the firſt, with his inabilitie: to realiſh both, cannot but make the Huſband fortunate, and the Wife well pleaſed: for that in recompence of this aduancement, ſhe may preſume ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to rule her head:<note place="margin">Reproofe of lofty Loue.</note> but, which moſt contents, ſhe ſhall haue the ſatiſfaction of her fancie a bed.</p>
               <p>If a houſe were as ſoon builded, as the Plot is drawen (qd <hi>Dondolo</hi>) Shepheards would diſdain to liue in Cotages: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo, if euery man could as ſoone compaſſe a Lady for himſelfe, as he can reporte the fortune of other: there muſt be an Act to make Ladies; or Lords muſt be glad of meane women. But admit, by the example of other mens aduancements, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the meaneſt may be rayſed, by the yéelding fancie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: I propheſie that ſuch an vpſtart, had more néede of ten eyes, toward the malice of his Wiues kindred, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one tung to moue her to kindneſſe. A woman cannot miſlike affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated proffers,<note place="margin">One kinſman hath an intereſt in anothers honor.</note> becauſe they procéede of loue: But her kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred diſdaineth his attempt, for that the concluſion tendeth both to their &amp; her diſhonour: A woman ſéeing her ſeruants paſſions, cannot but ſuſtaine him with pittie, her kindred
<pb facs="tcp:20497:58"/>ſéeing him in good way to be beloued, wil lye in waite for his life: For though ſhe may diſpoſe of her affection, her kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred hath an interreſt in her honour, which if ſhee conſent to ſtaine, or deminiſh, ſhe doth iniurie to her whole houſe.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Aragon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An inhumain parte.</note> aduenged the baſe choice of his Siſter, the Ducheſſe of <hi>Malfy,</hi> with the death of her ſelfe, her Children, and her Huſband: and alleaged in defence, that he had done no iniurie to Nature, but purged his Houſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour: for Nature (quoth he) is perfect, and who blemiſheth her is a monſter in Nature, whoſe head, without wrong to Nature may be cut off.</p>
               <p>Yea (quoth <hi>Soranſo</hi>) but, this Cardinall, for all his habit,<note place="margin">Defence, &amp;c.</note> and gloſe of Iuſtice, is for this act ſo often regeſtred for a Tirant, as I feare me hée will neuer come among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Saints: but the example of theſe mariages are vſuall,<note place="margin">Reproofe, &amp;c.</note> and ſuch enſuing vengeance is but rare, and beſides her eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall contentment, a woman looſeth none of her generall ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of dignitie by matching with her inferior.</p>
               <p>In déede (quoth <hi>Dondolo</hi>) in common curteſie ſhe enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them,<note place="margin">A woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that abaſeth her ſelfe in Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, in law lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but not in curteſie.</note> but in the ſtrickt conſtruction of the law, ſhe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded. And by this meane is bound to intertaine the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with familiaritie, leaſt they (being proude, or reputing her ſcornefully) doo croſſe her ouer the thumbes with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of her fancy. But admit the meane ſeruant marry his Miſtreſſe, and eſcapeth the mallice of her friends: which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, one among ten ſuch ſuters hardly attaineth.<note place="margin">The naturall deſires of a woman.</note> Let him yéeld to pay this rent for his good fortune: to ſuffer his wife, to rule, to direct, and to command his owne determinations. And where ſhe ordereth: the vncontrouled Wife, deſireth to bée ſerued with pompe, and to bée ſet forth with pride: which the ruling Huſband would repreſſe, as well for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his wiues honour, as for ſparing his owne purſſe.</p>
               <p>The vncontrouled wife deſireth to walke at libertie, and to be viſited of many: of which the ruling Huſband, would barre her: as well to preſerue his minde from miſtruſt, as to kéepe his Chimney from being fired.</p>
               <p>The vncontrouled wife diſdayneth the Countrie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth the Citie: which the ruling Huſband would miſlike,
<pb facs="tcp:20497:59"/>for that in the Countrie, the exerciſe of huſwiferie inlargeth his Wiues eſtunation, and in the Citie, idleneſſe hazardeth her reputation.</p>
               <p>The vncontrouled Wife deſireth without checke to prattle, &amp; without diſcretion to gouerne: which the ruling Huſband in no wiſe would allowe, for that many wordes is a blemiſh to his wiues modeſty, and the rule of his Wife is warrant ſufficient, for the wiſe to ouerrule him for a Woodcocke.</p>
               <p>Many other vanities follow the deſires of Women: which a man thus aduanc'ſt, muſt forbeare to chaſten, leaſt hée expoſe himſelfe to a thouſand dangers: for the wife ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pepper in the noſe, will ſuffer him, (yea perchaunce, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée to make him) a pray, to the diſpleaſure of his enemies: I meane her able friends and kindred: which bondage is not within the Paradice <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaketh of: For according to the opinion of ſundrie Philoſophers, as Nature will not bée controuled, for that ſhe createth: as Fortune is wonne with no praiers, becauſe ſhe is blinde, and ſhooteth at aduenture: no more dooth mariage allow of inequallitie, becauſe her wil is to deuide her benefits, and bleſſings among the married with indifferencie.</p>
               <p>To this end Mariage is likened to Sienes grafted in a ſtocke of contrarie qualitie: for as by growth and good order,<note place="margin">Iudgement in reproofe of lofty loue.</note> they both become of one nature, euen ſo, man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man vnited in this honourable eſtate, with good vſage, become of one diſpoſition. Againe, as Sienes thus grafted without ſpeciall Huſbandrie, while they be tender, come to no proofe: euen ſo man and woman, thus ioyned in Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie: vnleſſe in the prime of their Mariage, with equall care, they loue and cheriſh one another, in the waine of their yeares, the ſwéete Fruites of wedſock will be blaſted with repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Segnior Fabritio,</hi> to conclude <hi>Dondolos</hi> opinion, with his own iudgement, ſaid in truth, that Mariage could not away with ſuch ſeruitude: as the Huſband, who is wiſe and the chiefe, ſhould obay the wife, who in common conſtruction, is ſimple, weake, and the inferiour. And where a rich woman
<pb facs="tcp:20497:59"/>(as <hi>Dondolo</hi> hath ſaid) Marieth her poore Seruant, becauſe ſhe is the cauſe of his aduancement, ſhe wil looke to gouerne: which if ſhe doo, her indiſcretion will moue others to ſpeake, and her huſband to ſorrow: &amp; if he challenge the priueledge of a huſband to direct, he ſhall be bound to a life more bitter then Death. Not, but that in reſpect of his former eſtate, he may endure theſe croſſings of his wife, but becauſe, as he is growne in eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo is he growne in hautines of minde, and can now worſe brooke an vnkinde word, then in times paſt, an imurious déede. And therefore in <hi>Dondolos</hi> behalfe, I doo iudge <hi>Soranſo</hi> to be in an errour.</p>
               <p>I wil not diſpute againſt the authoritie of your iudgment (quoth <hi>Soranſo</hi>) but at aduenture if yonger brethren erre in mariage, God ſend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſtumble vpon no worſer fortune.<note place="margin">Men muſt haue regarde how they blame, leaſt they bite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues.</note>

               <p>Quéene <hi>Aurelia,</hi> who regarded, that <hi>Dondolo</hi> was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too lauiſh, in painting out of the naturall deſires of a woman, knew as well how to ſet forth his follies and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight: and therefore to take a modeſt reuenge (quoth ſhée) If happineſſe in Mariage conſiſteth ſo much in the Lordly rule of the huſband, then where a man marieth his inferior in reputation, there is a likelyhood of good agréement: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Segnior Dondolo,</hi> becauſe I think you maried your wife, with the ſame Iudgement, with which you manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the inconueniences of loftie Loue: I beſéech you, ſhew vs the bleſſings of this inferiour choyce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soranſo,</hi> and the reſt began to ſmile, to heare this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: for wel they knew <hi>Dondolo</hi> was intrapt with a ſlaunder of his owne reputation: but <hi>Dondolo,</hi> although he were a little gauled, ſet a reaſonable floriſh vpon his bace fancie: &amp; therefore (quoth he) as it is alreadie adiudged,<note place="margin">Defence of bace loue.</note> if a man marrie aboue his calling, he muſt beare with his Wife in folly, as much as ſhée was blinded in fancying of him: which bondage mariage can hardly endure: then if hée match with his inferiour, if contraries haue contrarie qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, <hi>per conſequence:</hi> ſhe will be as lowly, as the other is loftie: as pacient, as the other is proude: and as dutiful, as the other is diſoainfull: if the other prodiſgally ſpond, becauſe her portion is large, ſhe wil w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> huſwiferie ſpare, becauſe her

<pb facs="tcp:20497:64"/>and with great diligence, ſought to haue the ſeuerall Copies of all Bookes.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Iſmarito</hi> had well regarded the orderly ſorting of of theſe Bookes, and how by a ſhort Kalender, a Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great paine, might turne vnto any harde Queſtion, in any Science, and haue large reſolutions, and had taken a note of the title of certaine Bookes that he had not ſéene, and yet neceſſary to be reade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Segnior Philoxenus</hi> lead him into his owne priuate ſtudy,<note place="margin">It belongeth to a Gentleman to be ſeuere in many things.</note> which was furniſhed with Summaries, or abridgements of all Sciences: which he ſtudied with ſuch a iudgement, as there was no Arte, wherein he had not a ſpeciall knowledge which in argument he expoſed, with ſo good a wit and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as many times, hee grounded Maſters in that Science. And for that in all his actions he was the true patterne for a Gentleman to imitate, in honour of whome, and for the benefite of ſuch Gentlemen, as will follow his example, in vertue I am bound to ſet briefly downe, the chiefeſt cauſe of his ſtudie.</p>
               <p>Firſt and principally,<note place="margin">Diuinitie.</note> for the comfort both of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and ſoule. In Theologie, he read thoſe bookes, that clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the miſtes of Ignorance, and vnmaſked the deceipts of the ſuperſtitious Monkes, Friers, &amp;c. And contemplated in the ſwéete comfort of thoſe Authors, that expounded the hard paſſages of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>And for that <hi>Health</hi> is the moſt precious Iuell of the worlde,<note place="margin">Phiſicke.</note> knowing the Conſtitution of his owne bodye, hee ſtudied ſo much in <hi>Phiſick,</hi> as without the direction of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, he knew what meate and Medicine agréed with his nature.</p>
               <p>To miniſter <hi>Iuſtice</hi> vnto the ignorant multitude, and to kéepe himſelfe out of the Forfeits of Law,<note place="margin">Lawe.</note> he ſtudied the ciuill Law, and ſpecially, the Statutes of his Countrey: And (queſtionleſſe) the Gentleman, that is ignorant in the Lawes of his Countrey, is an enemie to himſelfe, and a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher in the common weale.</p>
               <p>In Militarie knowledge he was experienced, as well by ſeruice in the Fielde,<note place="margin">Arte Militarie.</note> as in reading <hi>Vegetius</hi> and other
<pb facs="tcp:20497:64"/>Authors in his ſtudy. And ſome trauel in this Arteie néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as well as commendable for a Gentleman: for it is not in ough for him, to be <hi>Togatus,</hi> as a Romane Orator, nor <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liatus,</hi> as a <hi>Grecian</hi> Philoſopher: in that he muſt as wel in the fielde looke his enemie in the face, as imbrace his friend in the houſe: and therefore, though he bare a Pen in his eare, to write his owne commentaries, he is bound to weare a Sworde by his ſide, to doo his Countrey ſeruice.</p>
               <p>For Gouerment and Ciuill behauiours,<note place="margin">Moralitie.</note> he read <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarches</hi> Morals: <hi>Gueuaraes</hi> Diall of Princes: the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Count <hi>Baldazar, Caſtillio:</hi> and others. And (in trueth) it is not ſo neceſſary, to be well borne, as to be wel quallited, and of good behauiour: wherefore, the ſtudie of Moralitie is very néedfull for a Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Hee (likewiſe) ſtudied <hi>Coſmographie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coſmography</note> and had therein commendable knowledge: which ſtudie cannot but much pleaſe and commend a braue minded Gentleman: For by the vertue thereof, he ſhalbe in his Study, able to ſuruaye the whole worlde: and with an agréeable diſcourſe, ſhall bound out a Stranger his owne Countrey.</p>
               <p>He was a good <hi>Hiſtoriographer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie.</note> and had read many rare Chronicles. How pleaſing this ſtudie is to a Gentleman, is liuely expreſſed in his owne nature, <hi>greedy of newes.</hi> And where may he haue better intelligence, then Cronicles? in which quietly in his owne Studie, he may receiue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Actes done throughout the whole worlde.</p>
               <p>He was a good Herauld, and had read much in Armorie:<note place="margin">Armorie.</note> an Arte moſt néedfull for a Gentleman, in that it is the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of himſelfe. And in my opinion, he that is not able to blaſon his owne Armes, is not worthy to beare them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Gentlemanly ſtudies he vſed, intermedled with others of more pleaſure, which I had not leaſure to regarde, nor memorie to beare away: but in all: is actions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiours, he expoſed a Gentleman ſo perfect, as in regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of him, but one halfe yeare,<note place="margin">Segnior Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loxenus a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Courner</note> a man might haue noted downe a Courtier, not inferiour to that of Count <hi>Baldezar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By that time <hi>Segnior Philoxenus</hi> had ſufficiently fed <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritoes</hi> eyes, with this honourable fauour: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſound of the

                  <hi>Iſmarito</hi> was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to leaue that earthly Paradiſe, to attend honorable <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loxenus</hi> into the great Chamber: againſt whoſe comming, the Table ſtoode furniſhed with many dainty diſhes. And Quéene <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and the reſt of the company were readie to ſalute him: which courteſie perfourmed, ſhe tooke her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place, and the reſt as they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Towards the latter end of this dinner, a meane fellow, guarded betwéene two Furies of the Kitchin, was brought <hi>coram nobis,</hi> for ſome pettie pilfering in the Scullerie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Segnior Philoxenus</hi> referred his payne to the iudgement of the Gentlemen and Gentlewomen there preſent.</p>
               <p>Some of the Gentlemen appoynted him ſome pleaſaunt payne in the office where he did the treſpaſſe: ſome other of the Gentlewomen, ouercome with a natural pitie, accepted his teares in ſatiſfaction,<note place="margin">Women are too pitiful to be Iudges.</note> and ſo diſcharged him: But the Doctor more rougher then the reſt, tooke him vp ſo ſhorte, as the poore fellow was driuen to ſay, <hi>Sir, where you may helpe, hurte not:</hi> The Doctor, to ſatiſfie his requeſt, and to kéepe his firſt determination,<note place="margin">A ſcoffer is ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny times ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his own weapon.</note> anſwered, <hi>To help to hang a Thiefe, is no hurte to the common weale,</hi> your petition ſhall be ſigned. The raſcall Théefe hearing this ſeuere iudgement (as the <hi>Italians</hi> are naturally quick witted) replyed: If chiefe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſhould ſet their hands to this Iuſtice, <hi>There would be more Lawyers hanged for ſtealing of houſes, then Rogues for robbing of hedges.</hi> The anſwere of the Doctor, and the replie of the poore fellow made the company ſo merry, that for the paſtime the treſpaſſer had made them, they remitted the puniſhment of his offence.</p>
               <p>The laughter quieted: in the commendation of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymans capacitie (quoth <hi>Soranſo</hi>) Maſter Doctor, this poore Snake, ſpake true <hi>Italian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea (quoth the Doctor) but he lackes the vertues of the ancient <hi>Romanes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Italians are wiſe, but euill conditioned.</note> couertly expreſſing thereby, that their wits were good, but their conditions were euill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bargetto</hi> enuying the fauours <hi>Iſmarito</hi> receiued, and for ſome priuate grudge,<note place="margin">Enuy euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with thoſe that are fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> about croſſing in argument, ſought by ſome pleaſant ſcoffe, to raiſe an vnkind quarel: and with
<pb facs="tcp:20497:65"/>that intent (quoth he) <hi>Segnior Iſmarito,</hi> I drinke vnto you, with a better affection, than I bare you in my ſléepe, for I dreamed, with my Rapier drawne, I chaſed you to your Chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſmarito,</hi> quickly anſwered,<note place="margin">Quarellers ſeek their owne miſcerefe.</note> I pleadge you <hi>(Segnior Bargetto)</hi> but with leſſe feare then you ſuppoſed to be in mée when you were aſléepe: for men after they are awake, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound dreames by contraries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bargetto</hi> deceiued of his expectation, was driuen by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to ſalue the wound he had giuen himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Segnior Philoxenus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A wiſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</note> to take away the cauſe of after kindneſſe, reaued the company of leaſure to iudge of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettoes</hi> quarelling dreame, or of <hi>Iſmaritoes</hi> croſſe expoſition, by kéeping of them exerciſed with a new deuice.</p>
               <p>Indéede (quoth he) Dreames are vncertaine, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be regarded, but there is a true kinde of diuina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Palmeſtrie,</hi> and ſo in looking in <hi>Maria Belochies</hi> hand,<note place="margin">Palmeſtrie, a prety idle qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie for a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</note> he vſed certaine names of Arte, and gaue a voluntarie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Iudgement: which fiered all the Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, with an earneſt deſire to know their fortune: and by this meanes, theremembrance of former queſtions was taken away. Wherein <hi>Segnior Philoxenus</hi> wiſdome may be a preſident for other Gentlemen that heare quarels a brée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to ſmoulder them in the ſhell: for men that bee angry,<note place="margin">A neceſſary note for a Gentleman.</note> are bound to their paſſion, when ſuch as are not moued, haue liberty to pacifie with diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Thus, with their ſpirites well pleaſed, Quéene <hi>Aurelia</hi> and the reſt of the companie, roſe from the Table, and after ordinarie curteſie ended, they pauſed a time by the Fire to put their wits in order, for the following diſputation: who at the ordinary houre entered the drawing Chamber, where the <hi>Eunuch</hi> ready to diſcharge his duety, vnto the Lute ſung this following Sonet.</p>

               </q>
               <p>This Sonet, moued the company to ſmile, not becauſe the inuention was vnwittie, but in that it was the fruits of Doctor <hi>Moſſenigoes</hi> Muſe, who to reuenge vpon himſelfe all the iniurie, which he had done to the ſexe of Women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came enamoured of <hi>Katherina Triſta,</hi> the waſpiſheſt Damoſel among the whole troupe of Gentlewomen: But knowing the Doctors <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> could not ſo ſubdue his affection, but that time would make them all ſporte and him ſmarte, they diſſembled their knowledge of his folly, as déepely as he couered the paſſions of his fancy: notwithſtanding to raiſe ſome ſpéech, and to ſet the Doctor a worke with hope:</p>
               <p>Quoth <hi>Aluiſa Vechio,</hi> this Sonet propheſieth a happie life to a young woman, and much comfort to an olde man if their fortunes be ſo good as to be maried together. And if I had as good a paſſage for my opinion, as I haue Reaſon to mayntayne the ſame: I would thinke to prooue this couple worthy of a place in <hi>Platoes</hi> Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Among ſo many good Orators (quoth Quéene <hi>Aurelia</hi>) you cannot want an aduocate.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Katharina Triſta,</hi> with a falſe eye, coniured the Doctor in this queſtion, to maintaine his Lone: who thus enioyned, tooke vpon him to maintaine <hi>Aluiſa Vechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oes</hi> opinion.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20497:66"/>
               <p>Quéene <hi>Aurelia</hi> licenſed him, and no aduerſary appeared to diſcourage him: whereupon (quoth he) where an old man marieth a yong woman, the contentment ſéemes to be much,<note place="margin">Defences where an olde man marieth a yong wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> and the comfort more: my reaſon is, the olde man hath not onely choſen a wife, to recreate him as a companion, but a Cooke to prepare choſen meates for his impaired appetite, and a Staffe to ſuſtaine his Age. The yong wife alſo may holde her ſelfe happie in this fortune: for ſhe hath choſen one whom ſhe may not onely rule, but commaund: and for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle paines, who will leaue her poſſeſt of a great deale of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. And this is moſt certaine, that cruel and wilde Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do moſt hurt, where their will is moſt reſiſted: and haue great compaſſion, where they finde no proffer of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe: The Lyon in his greateſt hunger, hurts not the wounded Shéepe: the Crocadile with teares waſheth the blood from a murthered man, and the raging Sea refreſheth the yéelding Réede: much more, a woman (that by nature is beautified with pittie) if ſhe rule without checke, will glory in the good vſage of her Huſband: and this is in dayly vſe, that the olde man in aſſemblies, findes his yong wife modeſt in her ſpéech, baſhfull in her lookes, and nice in occaſion of ſuſpition: and whether this behauiour procéeds of deſire to be praiſed, or of feare to be blamed, I conclude the cauſe with her commendation: for that to do well in hope of praiſe, comes of the incouragement of vertue: and to do well for feare of reprehenſion, is the ſigne of a good inclination.</p>
               <p>By Saint <hi>Anne</hi> Sir (quoth <hi>Soranſo,</hi>) you well deſerue a Fée, (eſpecially,<note place="margin">Reproofe, &amp;c.</note> of the yong wife) in that you ſo cunningly haue coloured her ouerſight, and ſo Clarkely haue commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her good vſage of her olde Huſband: but your Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tends to as ſmall effect, as the Fortune is euill, of a couple thus vnequally matched: for that common reaſon will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute your weake opinion, and dayly experience recordes the miſeries of the other.</p>
               <p>What likelyhoode of continuance, hath the Houſe whoſe ground worke is rotten, although the proſpect be beautifull and ſtrong? God wot the féeblenes of the Foundation will ouerthrowe the firmeneſſe of the vpper frame.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20497:67"/>
               <p>Compare this vnequall eſtate in Mariage, with this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſight in building, and you ſhall finde the diſcorde as great betwéen the one, as the ruine and decay ſpéedie in the other. The good and able Gouernment of the Huſband, is the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and ground worke of Mariage, and the beauty of the Wife, the bleſſing in hauing of Children, and the benefite of poſſeſſing liuings are the outward buildings of mariage: And as they are pleaſant in the eye of the world, euen ſo they greatly pleaſe the mindes of the maried, and giue a ſinguler grace to this honourable vocation. But, if the Gouernment of the Huſband be inabled with age: (as in truth) Olde Age is no other then a ſecond Infancie:</p>
               <p>In whoſe deſire, direction, diſcretion, and delight, there are imperfections: The beautie of the wife will be blaſted with ſorrow, for the inſufficiencie of her Huſband: euill Education will accurſe their bleſſing in hauing of children: and negligence will waſte their benefites of liuing. You holde a yong wife a companion to recreate an olde man, but he ſhall finde her a corſiue that will conſume him to death. A yong man concludeth, the ſwéeteſt ſolace in loue with ſighes: it is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like, an olde man endes it with teares: And God he knowes, he often wéepeth more of deſire to pleaſe his wife, then of any deuotion he hath to wantonneſſe: yet is all his paines to a fruitleſſe purpoſe, for that the Game finiſheth in his gréefe, and neither began nor endes in his wiues contentment.</p>
               <p>You are too quick in aduantage <hi>Segnior Soranſo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Defence, &amp;c.</note> (quoth the Doctor) olde Wine though it be dead in the mouth, yet is it warme in the Stomack, when the new fumes in the head, but comforteth not the hart.

               <p>The Sunne riſeth watriſhly, and is long before it giueth heate, where, in the afternoone it ſcorcheth the face: So a yong man deuideth his loue into a hundreth affections, and euery fancy pleaſed, there will but a little fall to his wiues ſhare: where an old mans loue is ſetled and his fancy is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon one: And as the recited examples, in age are in

               <p>Now, to content his yong wife, ſhe ſhal haue no cauſe to ſuſpect his Affection abroad, and ſhall not lack to be beloued at home.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, which delighteth a yong woman, (who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is ambitious) ſhe ſhal take her place, according to the grauitie of her Huſband, and not as her yong yéeres re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, to giue her an honourable name, the moſt precious Iuell with which a woman may be beautified, ſhe ſhal receiue graue directions from her huſband: and through the ſwéete delight ſhe taketh in hearing her good gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t commended, we will put them in execution.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Moſſenigo</hi> replyed not with this vehemencie, for any delight he had to commend this vnequall eſtate in Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but to flatter <hi>Katharina Triſta</hi> with an Ambitious hope of great reputation, in matching with his aged ſelfe: but ſhe (that knew a legge of a Larke, was better then the whole carkaſſe of a Kite) would none, God thank him.</p>
               <p>And to make him horn wood (if he perſeuered in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) in <hi>Soranſoes</hi> behalfe (quoth <hi>Bargetto</hi> his ancient croſſer) Maiſter Doctor, there is more pride in your words, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in your proofes: your hartie olde Wine muſt be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen out when it is broached, your dry wood is but a blaze, and your hotte Sunne doth but ſweat for ſorrow, that he is going to cowche in the darke Caues of <hi>Tarteſſus.</hi>

               <p>Clean contrary (quoth the Doctor) for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> follies of a yong man is ſufficiently puniſhed, by marying an olde woman:
<pb facs="tcp:20497:70"/>and the ſinnes of an olde widdowe are fully plagued, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching with a yong man: for that (contrary to your ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) neither can inioye the cauſe of their Mariage, without annoyance to their mindes: for his liking is faſtned on her riches, which ſhe will not but by neceſſitie leaue: and her loue is ſetled on his perſon, which for her pleaſure he diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to puniſh.<note place="margin">The euils in an olde widdow.</note> The vnfortunate yongman knowes not what gréefe he ioynes to his gaine, in matching with an olde widdow, till that experience breakes them foorth in ſighes: If his wife be rich, ſhe will looke to gouerne: if ſhe be poore, he is plagued both with beggerie &amp; bondage: if ſhe be proud, ſhe will hide her abilitie to maintaine her pompe: if ſhe be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, he is forſt to patience: if ſhe be ielous, he can hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure her rages. And to conclude, if the olde doting widdowe be frée from one of theſe faultes, ſhe is tied to forty euils of leſſe ſufferance: for if her Huſband commaund her will, ſhe ſtraightwaies ſaieth, her other Huſband was more kinde: if he chaunce to dine from home, ſhe willes him to ſup with his harlots: if he ſpend beyond her allowance, thus ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiles him: <hi>A Begger I found thee, and ſo thou wilt leaue me.</hi>

               <p>By your words, Maiſter Doctor [quoth <hi>Lucia Bella</hi>] the wife is the greateſt cauſe of this contention, aad yet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion, the Huſband is moſt blamed.</p>

               <p>Yea Madame (quoth <hi>Bargetto</hi>) Maiſter Doctor is now ſo conquered, as his tung is the Trumpet of your pleaſure.</p>
               <p>It is ſo (quoth the Doctor) to ſound out thoſe thinges which are true:<note place="margin">PLATOES Hell in Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> and in truth the yong Huſband often times maketh the euils good in déedes, which the olde wife vſeth but in words: for no longer then ſhe féedeth him with Coyne, ſhall ſhe enioy his companie: if ſhe rob not her Children to inrich him, ſhe ſhal lack no froward lookes, nor fowle vſage: if ſhe put him in poſſeſſion of her liuing, he ſtraightwaies diſpoſſeſſeth her of his loue, for hauing what he ſought, he will els where be enamoured.

If ſhée be determined to be merie, he (ſcornfully) telleth her, that it is as ſightly, for a tootheleſſe Mare to eate Marchpane, as for ſuch a wrinckled Mumpes to fall a bylling. If he come in well diſpoſed, and affably intreateth her, ſhe calleth him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling hipocrite, &amp; ſaith, he ſaluteth her with his tongue, but his heart imagineth of his minions abroade: ſhée run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the neighbors to complaine: in the meane while hée ſendeth her corne to the Market, and her cattel to the Faire. If the friends of good will, or neighbours of charitie, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to accord their contention (as ſhe imagineth to ſhame him) ſhée thundreth out a thouſand iniuries that hée dooth her: for her owne praiſe, ſhe ſaith, that of pure loue ſhe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him with nothing: and to reproach him, ſhe ſweares, hée hath ſpent her ſubſtance, and hateth her perſon: To ſhew her owne good huſwiferie, ſhée tels that ſhe worketh all day at her Diſtaffe: and to blaſe his vnthriftineſſe, ſhe ſhe weth how he plaieth away her gaines at Dice: ſhe crieth out, that (perforce) hée taketh what hée openly findeth, and priuilie ſtealeth what ſhe ſecretly hideth.</p>

               <head>The worthie, Hiſtorie of <hi>Phrigius</hi> and <hi>Pieria</hi> Reported by <hi>Segnior Philoxenus.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the Regiſter of Fame, wherein the Monuments of the vertuous are Cronicled, as preſidents for their poſteritie, I read, that in the famous Cittie of <hi>Miletum</hi> in <hi>Ionia,</hi> as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Prince and Gouernour, there raigned a worthie Duke called <hi>Nebeus,</hi> who to comfort and ſupport his aged yéeres, had to his Sonne and onely heire, <hi>Phrigius,</hi> a yong Gentleman of ſuch rare towardliues, as it may be a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether he were more beholding to Nature for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his body, to Vertue for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> qualities of his minde, or to Fortune in ſuffering him to be ſo nobly borne.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Myos</hi> a neighbour Cittie to <hi>Miletum,</hi> there was alſo a Prince of much renowne, named <hi>Pythes,</hi> whoſe Daughter and heire was faire <hi>Pieria,</hi> by whoſe vertues all <hi>Ionia</hi> was renowned. The ancient enuie betwéene the Citizens of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letum</hi> and <hi>Myos,</hi> was turned into amitie: and the open war betwéene Duke <hi>Nebeus</hi> and the noble <hi>Pithes,</hi> was peceably and honourably ended: All ſuch happie euents, ſuccéeded this following aduenture. Vpon the Feſtiual day of <hi>Diana,</hi> the Citizens of <hi>Myos,</hi> without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iniurie of Souldiers, might lawfully repaire to <hi>Miletum,</hi> to ſacrifice to <hi>Diana,</hi> vpon which ſafe conduct, with many other Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of <hi>Myos,</hi> faire <hi>Pieria</hi> waighted on her Mother to <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple, whoſe rare beauty was ſuch, as dazeled the eies of the beholders, like the reflections of a Mirror, placed againſt the Sunne.</p>
               <p>Among many that loued, and fewe or none that ſawe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of grace, ſuch was the renowne of her chaſte diſoain, yong <hi>Phrigius</hi> behelde <hi>Pieria</hi> with ſuch a ſetled eye, as <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> Temple ſhéelded him not againſt the Arrowes of Loue: but as a wounded Stag at the firſt ſéemeth little diſmaide: ſo <hi>Phrigius</hi> with an vnappalled chéer, returned to the Takes Pallace, and as a pledge of truce, he ſent his hart to <hi>Myos.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20497:81"/>The Ceremonies and Sacrifices of <hi>Diana</hi> ended, the wars renued, the wonted Maſſacres, Murthers, Rapines, and outragious cruelties practiſed by the Souldiers of either part: inſomuch as Lawe gaue place to Arnies, equitie to violence, and all publique order was peruerted, and vpon the point to be deſtroyed. The Captaines of <hi>Myos</hi> encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged their Souldiers of the one part, but the Souldiers of <hi>Miletum</hi> were driuen to comfort their Captaine with a threatning of diſgrace. But ah poore <hi>Phrigius,</hi> what anſwere ſhouldſt thou make? to ſée thy Souldiers ſlaine, and thy cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſpoyled, without proffers of reſcue were diſhonourable: to bend thy forces againſt thy owne hart, were vnnatural: to make the beſt choiſe of theſe two euils, required leaſure, and iudgement. And therefore aduiſedly to conſider of his eſtate, at this time <hi>Phrigius</hi> ſatiſtied his ſouldiers with hope of ſome ſpéedy venturous exploite, and dangered not his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, with the proffer of any violence: ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> either power kept their trenches peaceably, but yet with this indifferent perill, that they attended oportunitie, to make the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, and the other Captiues: for the long ciuill conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had now made the eſtate of either as deſperate, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of two that haue their ſubſtance vpon the chaunce of Dice, the one to haue all, the other to be vndone.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Phrigius</hi> had with ſtender hope thus quieted the acclamations of the people, he retired himſelfe into a ſolitary Chamber, to be the ſole companion of his outragious paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with whom he thus deuiſed.</p>
               <p>Ah traiterous eyes, betraiers of my whole body, the ſcourge of <hi>Miletum,</hi> and enemies of my honour: the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of <hi>Oedipus</hi> is too gentle for your iniuries: what dooſt thou ſay? oh blaſphemous tung, riuall of humanitie, calumner of Beautie, and hinderer of thy Countries peace: thou reprocher of vertue, and <hi>Phrigius</hi> welfare: know to thy ſhame, the perfection of my eyes haue conſtantly behelde <hi>Pieria,</hi> whoſe deuine beauties, emblemed in humane ſhape, dazeleth the yongeſt ſight in <hi>Ionia.</hi> Then to reuile them thus, thou tiranniſieſt nature: to demaund why I loue and ſerue Beautie, thy queſtion is blinde, and deſerueth a double
<pb facs="tcp:20497:81"/>anſwere: But aye me, though my eyes and loueh aue doone but what is iuſt, Fortune hath dealt too rigourouſly with me, to render my hart captiue to his Daughter, who is the riuall of my Father: what hope may I giue to my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? when poſſibilitie of comfort is taken away: the Parents are readie to ſheath their Swoords in one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers entrailes: is it then like the Children ſhall imbrace a mutuall affection? O no: for though milde <hi>Venus</hi> conſent that they loue, wrathfull <hi>Mars</hi> will ſeuer their affection. O cruel Warre, thou art not vnproperly called the ſcourge of God,<note place="margin">The vengance of Warre.</note> for in thée is contained a greater vengeance then might be imagined by man: thou armeſt the Sonne againſt the Father, the Vnckle againſt the Nephewe, the Subiect againſt his Soueraigne: Thy drinke is blood, thy foode the fleſh of men, thy fiers are flming Citties, thy pleaſures ſpoyling of Widdowes, rau iſhment of Virgins, ſubuerſion of Lawes and publique benefite: thy Iudges, Tiranny and Iniuſtice: and where thou remaineſt, her knowne enemy is not ſo dangerous, as the fained fréend.</p>
               <p>But why exclaime I of Warre, who double Crowned <hi>Alexander</hi> with the riches of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affrica?</hi> who honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Caeſar</hi> with imperiall triumphes? and rewarded <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi> for the trauailes of his life, with renowne after death? by whom Millions of men are regiſtred in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life booke of Fame: and through whome <hi>Phrigius</hi> giueth expectation of benefite to his Countrey, comfort to his aged Father, and honour to his poſteritie.</p>
               <p>I receiued my wound in the time of peace, nay in the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhall I then exclaime of Peace, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braide Chaſtitie? fowle fall the hart that ſhould moue, and ſhame woorme the tung that pronounceth ſuch blaſphemie: O bleſſed peace, thou faſt chaineſt Treaſon, Tiranny Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Theft, and Wrath, with all diſturbers of common tranquilitie, and in the higheſt dignities, placeſt Iuſtice,<note place="margin">The bleſsings of peace.</note> Pietie, Temperance, Concorde and Loue, with many other Morrall vartues, by whome the lewde are chaſtened, the good are cheriſhed, and Common weales proſper and flouriſh.

The wrath and ſtormes of war, is turned to calme and temperate peace: the bloſſoms of enmitie are altred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fruits of amyty: and the roote of mallice growne to the trée of pittie. The Nobles in honor of this mariage, lauiſht out their treaſure, in al their triumphes and ſhowes to be in good equipage. The meaner Gentlemen, by excéeding coſt, learned by experience, how afterward to ſpare. The Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens with giftes of great imprize, preſented their dutiful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. The learned eterniſed this mariage peace, in tables of memorie. The Cleargy ſong Himnes of ioy, the common people rung the Belles, and euery ſort ſhewed ſome token of delight.

               <p>VPon New yeares day at night, about nine of the Clock, in an incloſed place in the great hall: after Quéene <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia,</hi> and her choſen attendants, had danced certaine ſolemne
<pb facs="tcp:20497:85"/>
                  <hi>Almaines,</hi> appeared a high Mountain, the Forrteſtery wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was of faire Bay trées, Pomegranate, Lymons, Oren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Date trées, and other fruites of moſt pleaſure: among the Moſſy rockes appeared Snailes, Lyſards, Moles, frogs, Greſhoppers, and ſuch like vnuenimous vermin, and by the fountaines which run aſlant the ſide of the Mountaine, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Vnicorns, Elephants, Camelions, Camels, and other beaſtes of honor, as if they were appointed by Nature, to garde thoſe ſacred ſtreames, from being troubled with the raſcall multitude of Cattell, which domeſticall deſart was perfected with ſuch art, as nature confeſſed her excellent cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be vanquiſhed by mans induſtrie. This Mountaine which reſembled ſome wildernes in <hi>Arabia,</hi> dewed with the pleſant ſprings of <hi>Affrica,</hi> by a ſtil motion, remoued towards the vpper end of the Hall, into the full preſence of Quéene <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and the moſt ſtately company. In the midſt of this Mountaine was an Arbour of ſwéet Eglentine, intercour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Roſes, and fully ſhadowed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpreading bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the purples Vine: in which vpon a ſtately throne ſate <hi>Diana</hi> attired all in white, and at her féete were the nine Muſes, clothed in ſeuerall colours, according to their ſeuerall qualities, ſounding heauenly harmony, hoth with voice and inſtrument: out of this arbor ſprang a Bay trée, in which was the <hi>Hyen,</hi> which at pleaſure being both Male and Female, expreſſed the full power of vertue: who though ſhe hath the forme and habit of a woman, yet is her eſſentiall ſubſtance compounded of both kindes. At the foot of this hill was the Monſter Enuy armed with fire and ſword, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their paſſage, which aduentured to clime the Mount: a Forreſt Nimph clad all in Flowers, in a ſhort ſpéech decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>Diana</hi> and the Muſes, who in the golden age had their Pallaces in the Forreſts, Mountaines and Riuers of pleaſure, throughout the whole worlde: now by the iniurie of time, were driuen to their Sanctuary of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> at the foote whereof the Monſter Euny kept, to hinder the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſuch as attempted with their renowne, to ſet thoſe Ladies at libertie: who hearing by Fame, the glory of this honorable company, were ariued by hope, that the vertue of
<pb facs="tcp:20497:85"/>ſome of the troupe, ſhould redéeme them from captiuitie, and therefore, ſhe ſummoned the knights preſent, to make triall of their valors, and the Ladies of their vertues: which ſaid, ſhe retired back into the mountaine: the gentlemen and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, hauing a cunning foreknowledg of the intent of this ſhow armed themſelues, with ſundry attempts to ouercome this mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter. <hi>Soranſo, Dondolo, Iſmarito,</hi> &amp; <hi>Faliero,</hi> drew their rapiers, &amp; aſſailed Enuy, but dry blowes auailed not, ſo that they were conquered, &amp; committed to the gayle of Tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. <hi>Maria Belochie, Franceſchina Sancta, Lucia Bella, Helena Dulce,</hi> and other Ladies, and damoſels, indeuored to charme him, with the ſwéet ſound, and heauenly impreſſions of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.
